## Features

- **Ordinary files and folders.** A project is a folder on disk. Nothing is imported, indexed, or synced, and edits stay in memory until you save.
- **Tabs as workspaces.** Each tab contains a split tree of editors, image and PDF viewers, and terminals.
- **Persistent terminals.** Shells run in a detached session server and reattach when Mojian opens again.
- **Built-in Git diffs.** Inspect staged, unstaged, and untracked work without leaving the window.
- **Remote projects over SSH.** Files, Git, and terminals run directly on the configured host on macOS and Linux.
- **Native UI in one Go binary.** [MyGo](https://mygo.egoist.dev) draws the interface with Metal on macOS, GTK 3 on Linux, and Direct3D 11 on Windows. No Electron or JavaScript build.

## Installation

Download the latest build from [Releases](https://github.com/ox0pine/mojian/releases).

### macOS

| Architecture | Download |
|---|---|
| Apple Silicon | `mojian-<version>-arm64.dmg` |
| Intel | `mojian-<version>-amd64.dmg` |

Open the disk image and drag Mojian into Applications. Release builds are ad-hoc signed rather than notarized. If macOS blocks the first launch, right-click Mojian in Finder and choose **Open**.

### Linux

Mojian requires GTK 3 and a desktop session.

Install the Debian or RPM package:

```sh
sudo apt install ./mojian_<version>_<arch>.deb        # Debian, Ubuntu
sudo dnf install ./mojian-<version>-1.<rpm-arch>.rpm  # Fedora, RHEL
```

`<arch>` is `amd64` or `arm64`; `<rpm-arch>` is `x86_64` or `aarch64`.

For a per-user installation without root, put `install.sh` and `mojian-<version>-linux-<arch>.tar.gz` in the same folder, then run:

```sh
sh install.sh
```

### Windows

Mojian requires Windows 10 1809 or later.

| Architecture | Download |
|---|---|
| x64 | `mojian-setup-<version>-amd64.exe` |
| ARM64 | `mojian-setup-<version>-arm64.exe` |

The installer installs for the current user, without administrator rights. Builds are unsigned for now, so SmartScreen may ask before running one. With updates enabled, the one-line install is:

```powershell
irm https://github.com/ox0pine/mojian/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 | iex
```

Windows is supported as a local-only client: local files, Git, images, PDFs with Poppler, and local terminals work; SSH and remote projects are not available there yet.

## Projects and files

Press `Cmd+O` on macOS or `Ctrl+O` on Linux and Windows to open a folder. The project chip switches between recent projects; on macOS and Linux the server chip switches between Local and configured SSH hosts. Each project keeps its own tabs, panes, and recent files.

From a terminal, pass the project folder or a file:

```sh
mojian .                        # the current folder
mojian ~/git/abc                # a project folder
mojian ~/git/abc/README.md      # a file, with its folder as the project
```

The file opens in the focused pane of the project's saved layout. The app bundle's binary is `Mojian.app/Contents/MacOS/Mojian`: link it as `mojian` to use the name in these examples, and run `mojian --help` for the usage. On Windows, run the installed `Mojian.exe` directly, or add its folder to `PATH` to use `Mojian` in these examples.

A launch from a terminal detaches at once: the prompt returns, and closing the terminal or pressing Ctrl+C no longer ends the window. A launch without a terminal, such as from Finder, stays in place, and errors from a detached window go to `app.log` in Mojian's data folder.

To run `mojian` from zsh or bash, **Settings › Advanced › Shell command** installs an alias in `~/.zshrc` or the bash startup file; the same row updates or removes it.

The Open Folder picker lists folders reached through symbolic links, and its **Hidden folders** switch beside Cancel includes names that start with a dot.

On first launch, Mojian opens `~/Documents/Mojian` when no project is selected and leaves a welcome note if the folder is empty.

The Explorer shows the folder as it exists on disk:

- Toggle it with `Cmd+B` / `Ctrl+B`.
- Filter the visible tree with its search field.
- Search every project file with **Open File**, `Cmd+P` / `Ctrl+P`.
- Create files and folders directly in the tree.
- Right-click to open, rename, duplicate, copy, cut, copy a path, reveal, or move an entry to trash.

Generated folders such as `.git`, `node_modules`, `dist`, and `build` stay hidden.

## Tabs, panes, and terminals

Press `Cmd+T` / `Ctrl+Shift+T` to open a tab, as in Ghostty. Split the focused pane right or down with `Cmd+D` / `Shift+Cmd+D` (`Ctrl+Shift+O` / `Ctrl+Shift+E` on Linux); left and up have no default keys, and can be assigned in **Settings › Keyboard**. A new pane opens with an inline file search.

Drag a pane by its header onto another pane's edge to move it. Use `Option+Cmd` / `Ctrl+Alt` and the arrows to move focus, `Shift+Cmd+Enter` / `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` to zoom the focused pane, `Cmd+W` to close a pane, and `Option+Cmd+W` / `Ctrl+Alt+W` to close the tab.

Double-click a tab to rename it, double-click a pane header to zoom it, or right-click a tab for more actions.

Press `Ctrl` and the backtick key (`⌃` + backtick on macOS) to toggle a terminal at the project root. Terminals are panes, so they can be split, moved, zoomed, and closed like any other pane. On macOS, Linux and Windows, quitting Mojian leaves their shells alive and reopening attaches them again.

Press `Shift+Cmd+S` / `Ctrl+Shift+S` on macOS or Linux to open an SSH terminal to a host from **Settings › Hosts**.

## Writing and previewing

Code keeps line numbers and prose wraps. Syntax highlighting covers Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, C and C++, Swift, Kotlin, Ruby, JSON, YAML, TOML, SQL, HTML, CSS, Markdown, and more.

Markdown panes switch between source and preview from the pane header. **Settings › Editor** can render new `.md` files by default. Images, including SVG, open in a contained viewer. PDFs page through every page: drawn with Poppler's `pdftoppm` when it is installed, else with PDFKit on macOS.

Press `Cmd+S` / `Ctrl+S` to write every unsaved note atomically. Unsaved work is also written when the window closes.

## Git, commands, and settings

### Git

Press `Ctrl+Shift+G` on both platforms to compare the working tree with `HEAD`. Statuses appear on the left and a two-gutter diff on the right, including staged, unstaged, and untracked work.

### Command palette

Press `Shift+Cmd+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P` to search commands, files, and tabs with fuzzy matching.

### Settings

Press `Cmd+,` / `Ctrl+,` to open the separate Settings window. It includes General, Appearance, Editor, Terminal, Shell, Notifications, Keyboard, Hosts, Git, Advanced, and Updates.

Search finds preferences by name or keyword, and `Cmd+F` focuses the search field. Mojian follows the system appearance by default; **View › Appearance** overrides it, and the Appearance page's theme grid picks one of ten color themes (Petal, Mist, Meadow, Dusk, Tide, Apricot, Aurora, Dune, Paper, Plain) for the window, the editor and terminals.

## Remote projects

1. Add a host in **Settings › Hosts**.
2. Choose **Set Up Server** on its row. Mojian uploads `mojian-server` and `libghostty-vt` to `~/.local/share/mojian` and checks that the server answers.
3. Choose the host from the server chip and open a folder.

Setup requires no root access, listening port, or system service.

The Explorer lists files on the host. Files are read when opened, and saves and file operations write straight back. Git also runs on the host. Once opened, a project stays loaded, so switching back restores its tabs and terminals without reading it again.

Each project in the project chip, local or remote, has a trash button on its right. It removes that project from the list and unloads it if it is open, saving first when it is the open project: a local close switches to the next recent project, and a remote one goes back to the last local project. The host's connection is kept after **Set Up Server** and while any project on it is loaded, so its folder picker opens without connecting again; it is released when the last project on that host is removed, and at quit.

The remote server and its terminals stay alive when Mojian or the SSH connection disconnects. Each terminal remembers the server that owns it. Run `mojian-server -stop` to end a server explicitly.

## Updates

Open **Settings › Updates** to check the latest signed GitHub release:

- **Check for Updates** reports whether a newer version is available.
- **Install Update** downloads it and verifies its signature.
- **Restart to Update** applies a staged update and relaunches Mojian.

Self-updates require a writable installation, such as the macOS app bundle, the per-user Linux archive, or the Windows installer. A `.deb` or `.rpm` installed in `/opt` is updated by its package manager instead.

## Keyboard shortcuts

The labels in Mojian follow the platform. These are the default bindings; **Settings › Keyboard** can rebind, reset, or unbind them. The tab and pane defaults follow Ghostty: `⌘` for files, tabs and tools, `⌘⌥` for moving through panes, and `⌃` for the panels beside them.

| Action | macOS | Linux |
|---|---|---|
| Open project | `⌘O` | `Ctrl+O` |
| Open file | `⌘P` | `Ctrl+P` |
| New file | `⌘N` | `Ctrl+N` |
| New folder | `⇧⌘N` | `Ctrl+Shift+N` |
| Rename selected entry | `F2` | `F2` |
| Move selected entry to Trash | `⌘⌫` | `Ctrl+Backspace` |
| Save | `⌘S` | `Ctrl+S` |
| New tab | `⌘T` | `Ctrl+Shift+T` |
| Close pane / tab | `⌘W` / `⌥⌘W` | `Ctrl+Shift+W` / `Ctrl+Alt+W` |
| Next / previous tab | `⇧⌘]` / `⇧⌘[` | `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` |
| Show tab 1-9 | `⌘1…⌘9` | `Alt+1…Alt+9` |
| Split right / down | `⌘D` / `⇧⌘D` | `Ctrl+Shift+O` / `Ctrl+Shift+E` |
| Split left / up | assign in Settings | assign in Settings |
| Focus neighboring pane | `⌥⌘` + arrows | `Ctrl+Alt` + arrows |
| Move focused pane | drag, or assign in Settings | drag, or assign in Settings |
| Zoom pane | `⇧⌘↩` | `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` |
| Toggle file tree | `⌘B` | `Ctrl+B` |
| Toggle terminal | `⌃` + backtick | `Ctrl` + backtick |
| SSH terminal | `⇧⌘S` | `Ctrl+Shift+S` |
| Git diff page | `⌃⇧G` | `Ctrl+Shift+G` |
| Command palette | `⇧⌘P` | `Ctrl+Shift+P` |
| Settings | `⌘,` | `Ctrl+,` |

Two Ghostty keys stay with the editor: `⌘[` / `⌘]` indent and outdent, and `⌘Enter` inserts a line below.

On Windows, `Cmd` bindings become `Ctrl`; **Settings › Keyboard** shows the active keys. Terminal shortcuts are available on macOS, Linux and Windows. SSH shortcuts are available on macOS and Linux only.

## Build from source

Mojian requires Go 1.27.3 or later. MyGo is pinned as a Go tool in `go.mod`, so the first `go tool mygo` command downloads the exact version.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ox0pine/mojian.git
cd mojian

go tool mygo dev        # live-reloading development app
go test ./...           # unit and integration tests
go tool mygo vet .      # go vet plus MyGo's UI lifetime checks
```

Use `go tool mygo dev -web` to open the interface in a browser with files kept in memory.

### Headless UI harness

`cmd/harness` serves the real window and Settings views to an MCP client
through [mygo-mcp](https://github.com/auron-labs/mygo-mcp), so an agent can
inspect, click, type into and screenshot the interface without a desktop
window:

```sh
go run ./cmd/harness                 # http://127.0.0.1:8080/mcp
go run ./cmd/harness -addr 127.0.0.1:8090
```

Each run seeds a disposable project in the temp directory, and the fixtures
never open native windows, start terminals or touch your projects and
settings. The endpoint has no authentication, so keep it on loopback.

### Release builds

```sh
go tool mygo build -platform darwin/arm64,darwin/amd64
go tool mygo build -platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64
go tool mygo build -platform windows/amd64,windows/arm64
```

Build output lives under `build/<os>-<arch>/`. macOS produces `.app` and `.dmg`; Linux produces `.tar.gz`, `.deb` and `.rpm`; Windows produces the app and `mojian-setup-<version>-<arch>.exe`.

After changing the session protocol or `cmd/mojian-server`, rebuild the embedded remote binaries:

```sh
go generate ./internal/remotebin
```

### Publishing a release

Push a `vX.Y.Z` tag to run [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml). The workflow tests the tree, builds every platform, creates a draft release, uploads the installers and `SHA256SUMS`, and publishes only after every upload succeeds. See [`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md) for the full process.

Each release contains:

- macOS: `mojian-<version>-arm64.dmg` and `mojian-<version>-amd64.dmg`
- Linux: `mojian-<version>-linux-{amd64,arm64}.tar.gz`, matching `.deb` and `.rpm` packages, and `install.sh`
- Windows: `mojian-setup-<version>-{amd64,arm64}.exe`, `install.ps1`, and `mojian-<version>-windows-{amd64,arm64}.tar.gz`
- Signed update archives (`*-darwin-*.tar.gz`, `*-linux-*.tar.gz`, `*-windows-*.tar.gz`) and `update-<target>.json` manifests
- `SHA256SUMS`

## Design

Mojian uses ink `#1F1B16`, paper `#FBF7EF`, and vermilion `#D24A2B`. Almost everything is ink on paper; only the cursor keeps the vermilion, the one voice the page raises.
